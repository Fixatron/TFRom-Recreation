Stage Map [It took me a while to figure this one out, does it represent the path for level 9? not really, no. Its a map of the stages with respect to warping through time]
Stage 1 and 2 are present time, stage 3 is warping to the furture, stage 4 and 5 are future levels, stage 6 warps back to present time, stage 7 is present/past time, Stage 8 goes back further in time, Stage 9 is far in the past and stage 10 is a warp back to the future, through a "time tunnel"
