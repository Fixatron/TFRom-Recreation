#   This is a recreation of Convoy No Nazo
#   Mostly a rom-study to learn NES 6502 assembly


#   things I've learned from this exercise
#   -theres a player speed setting
#   -a strange boss battle can be found by replacing current_level 1c with 14 or 16 when the bumblebee warp is activated, also at the end of the other warp
#   -bullet velocity will by increased by how fast player is moving
#   



#   Things I want to change
#
#   - Better hit boxes
#   - new characters
#   - simultaneous 2 players
#   - megaman style boss fights
#   - pre-fight boss dialog
#   - better music
#   - pause menu
#   - health bar


#   FCEUX stuff
#   - Fn+] for pause/unpause rom
